class TimeSeriesData(models.Model):
    """Copied from django-timeseries, modified so we can use the primary key as
    a combination of the timestamp and the sensor it's associated with. Unlike
    in the examples in https://github.com/anthonyalmarza/django-timeseries, we
    are going to store one big TS table for sensor data (as well as an archive
    table for old aggregated data).

    This doesn't have add_datum because it doesn't really map to the SQL - just
    create a new datum with the correct devicesensor and it will raise a
    IntegrityError if it already exists

    Original docs:
        Abstract model that can be inherited from to facilitate building out
        your timeseries data framework.

        N.B. TimeSeries models should have a ForeignKey reference to an
        "owning" model and TIMESERIES_INTERVAL timedelta instance.

    Attributes:
        ts (datetime): Timestamp of this data
        sensor (DeviceSensor): related sensor object on a specific device
